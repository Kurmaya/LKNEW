            <h2>Bubblebot</h2>
            <p>Bubble bot is a powerful drone that you can keep by your side and quickly launch it to run on varied surfaces against gravity. It is capable of transitioning from ground to wall and perpendicular surfaces. The mechanism, materials and components used, makes this bot a cost effective product. It has a carbon fibre body making it light weight and rigid. It delivers a enough power to move across different surfaces and can be effortlessly piloted through the Internet. It can run autonomously and can also be controlled and driven manually when/if required. We predict the use of this bot for structural health monitoring, Infrastructure Inspection, photography, Asset Management, Millitary Purpose, Building Facade cleaning (glazing).</p>

            <h2>Antipode</h2>
            <p>A hypersonic business aircraft concept designed to fly from New York to London in 11 minutes. Rocket boosters will initially lift the aircraft from the ground to an altitude of 12,000 m (40,000 ft) and propel it to Mach 5, when scramjets will ignite accelerating the aircraft up to Mach 24. A nozzle in the aircraft's nose will apply NASA's Long Penetration Mode concept to scoop-up air to cool the aircraft.</p>
